  description: Framing is an indispensable narrative device for news media because even the same facts may lead to conflicting understandings if deliberate framing is employed. By developing a media frame classifier that achieves state-of-the-art performance, we systematically analyze the media frames of 1.5 million New York Times articles published from 2000 to 2017.

# - title: Formation of heavy d-electron quasiparticles in Sr3Ru2O7
#   image: Pub_327.png
#   description:
#     Using APRES, we find that the bands in Sr3Ru2O7 look more like in heavy fermion material than in a normal metal. We present a detailed investigation into the formation of this particular electronic  structure.

# - title: Anisotropic energy gaps of iron-based superconductivity from intraband quasiparticle interference in LiFeAs
#   image: Pub_LiFeAs.png
#   description:
#     In contrast to earlier photoemission reports, we show that the gaps in iron based superconductors are not isotropic but modulated with angle.

#   image: Pub_nemat1.png
#   description:
#     We discovered an electronic nematic in the iron based superconductor Co-CaFe2As2! This state is by now confirmed and quite well characterized  by transport, photoemission, and more SI-STM experiments.
