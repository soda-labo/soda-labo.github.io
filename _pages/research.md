### Dynamic creation of nationwide virtual panels for collective behavior prediction (Tier-1)
The ability to predict, explain, and change the behavior of other humans has long been of interest to both the scientific community and the business world. Decades of research has made great advances in improving our understanding of human behavior online and offline, especially with the advent of social media. Predicting how individuals will react to future social, political, and economic events can be challenging and complex, however. More importantly, providing an explanation as to why such behavior occurs and determining if it can be changed is even more challenging as this would require extensive and detailed profiling of individuals over time.

The overall objective of this research is to develop a predictive system that enables stakeholders (e.g. policymakers, politicians, celebrities, and business organizations) to know how people will behave in the future and that provides a solid understanding of these behaviors to help stakeholders’ strategic planning. In particular, we will exploit past behaviors to predict future behaviors as the former are considered to be vital for personalization and recommendation systems but are yet to be explored in public opinion and human behavior studies.

The specific aim of this research is to develop a system that predicts behaviors (i.e. sentiments and stances expressed by individuals on social media) regarding a future news event based on the individuals’ background factors and past behaviors and provides an explanation of the predicted behaviors with detailed user profiles.

This research makes empirical contributions to both the social science and computer science fields. Specifically, it advances the state of knowledge regarding how individuals’ intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics and past behavior determine their future behaviors, how human behaviors are connected to each other, how to model news events and individual behaviors (sentiments and stance regarding a news event) on social media, and the extent to which individuals’ intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics and past behaviors can determine their future behaviors. The resulting system will enable us to have a precise understanding of what makes the public happy, concerned, angry, and prone to act so that better solutions can be provided for the stakeholders and the risk of a bad reputation can be reduced.


### Developing AI systems to monitor diversity and fairness in media (Tier-1)
Singapore is well-known as a multiracial and multicultural society. Integration and cooperation in such a society depend on the perception of “self” and “the other.” Those perceptions, however, can be easily influenced. It is not surprising that media is one of the important sources that influence people’s perception of the other since people spend a considerable amount of time on media consumption. Their perception of, belief about, and attitudes toward the other are constantly shaped by the mediated images in the media. With the high penetration of smartphones, the term “media” not only refers to traditional mass media, but also extends to social media and online games with which people actively engage in their everyday life. Media’s influence thus becomes more powerful. Understanding the impact of media, for example, how media portrays each demographic group, is therefore a crucial step toward social integration. 

While many social science scholars have studied diversity and fairness in media, most of the studies are conducted on a small scale and have not built working systems to illustrate the updated status of media practice. Consequently, these studies have not provided an easy-to-use tool to raise the public’s awareness of diversity and fairness in media and missed opportunities to transform the public into watchdogs on media.

In this research, we aim to develop AI systems to monitor diversity and fairness in media. As diversity and fairness are big concepts and a Tier-1 research project provides a strong foundation for further research, we will mainly focus on a relatively well-formulated problem—modeling gender diversity and fairness. Furthermore, we will focus on social media platforms based on their popularity and impact. In other words, our AI systems aim to monitor gender diversity and fairness from text and images shared by influential social media accounts (e.g., those of government agencies and top commercial brands) in Singapore.  We will provide a transparent view of gender diversity and fairness in social media posts to the public and policy makers, raise their awareness, and help them understand the situation and improve it. 

We will break down the computational modeling of gender diversity and fairness in social media posts into a series of multimodal machine learning tasks, such as gender detection, stereotype detection, and context inference. There have been many studies on some tasks (e.g., gender detection); however, other tasks (e.g., stereotype detection) are challenging. For the former, we will explore and utilize relevant libraries or training/testing data. For the latter, we will build a codebook, label the data, and train the multimodal machine learning models.

Our overarching goal is to explore and understand new quantum states of electronic matter on the atomic scale. To do so, we use and develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom.

Our goal is to build instruments and develop techniques that enable us to address the questions we find most interesting. This is possible thanks also to Milan's broad background with different research themes and technologies: he learned his trade in [Seamus Davis’ SI-STM lab](http://davisgroup.lassp.cornell.edu/) and with [Felix Baumberger](http://dpmc.unige.ch/gr_baumberger/index.html), and later moved as an [ETH fellow](http://www.ethfellows.ethz.ch/) to [Andreas Wallraff’s qudev lab](http://www.qudev.ethz.ch/) where he investigated coupled cavity arrays in circuit QED. We further have group members with different background and interests, working together on physics and instrumentation.

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**Scanning tunneling noise spectroscopy (STNS).** We have developed a novel cryogenic MHz amplifier that allows us to measure not only the average tunneling current, but also its fluctuation! This has many applications: one can detect the fluctuations of the electronic states, peculiar tunneling processes, and shot noise. We have used this instrument to discover charge trapping in the insulating layer of the cuprates, connected to the c-axis mystery, and to measure the doubling of the charge due to Andreev processes to the superfluid in a lead sample.


**Mott physics and high-temperature superconductivity.** Questions of interest include: (i), How does the Mott state collapse upon doping and how is this related to the complex phase diagram of high-temperature superconductors? (ii), What is the strange metal phase seen in correlated electron systems? Is this an exotic long-range entangled state? What is the mechanism of dissipation in that state? (iii), Why is the transition temperature in high-temperature superconductors so high? We have worked on iridates, rhodates, and cuprates.

**Nanofabricated "Smart Tips"**.

One of the  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these “smart tips” is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.  A prototype of a smart tip is shown to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB.

**Josephson STM.** Josephson STM has the ability to gain insight into spatial variations of the order parameter, or superfluid density. We have managed to, for the first time, use JSTM with atomic resolution on a quantum material.
We have used atomic-resolution Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy to reveal a strongly inhomogeneous superfluid in the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. The results and their implications are published in Nature.

We also detected and investigated a quite particular YSR state in the same material.

**Ultra-stable SI-STM instrument.**  ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/STMHead.png){: style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}
For SI-STM, having the most stable STM head is key. We have used finite element simulations, good choices in material science, and craftsmanship to build the most stable STM head in the world, to our knowledge. See publication in RSI.


**Strange Metals.** The strange metal phase might be the most mysterious phase of high-temperature superconductors. Here, the electrical resistivity grows linearly with temperature T in large areas of the phase diagram, with a mean free path that diminishes to a fraction of the interatomic distance. T-linear resistivity is often associated with quantum critical points and marginal-Fermi-liquid physics. In strange metals, the mystery seems to go even further: we deal with something that looks like a quantum critical phase over an extended range of the phase diagram instead of cumulating in a point. There exists no consistent theory for strange metals, leading to more adventurous new approaches including the holographic theories that use insights from quantum gravity to explain strange metals (a recent textbook on this was written by our colleagues at Leiden University, Schalm and Zaanen).
We are part of the 'Strange Metal consortium NL' that includes the groups of Hussey, Golden, van Heumen, Zaanen, Schalm, Stoof and Vandoren. 

**Magnetic fluctuations and electron spin resonance.**

**Twisted bilayer graphene and other material with super-periodicities.**
We have proposed that artificial super-periodicities can lead to improved superconductivity, both because of increased density of states and because of phase space arguments (see image from our SciPost publication below). Perhaps for different reasons, twisted bilayer graphene has been shown to superconduct! We are investigate this material with the groups of Efetov, Baumberger, and van der Molen.
