# Open Positions: PhD Students (Fall 2025)

The Soda Lab is currently seeking PhD students for Fall 2025. Our research focuses on computational social science and social computing, leveraging large-scale data and machine learning techniques.

## Research Directions

Our current areas of focus include:

1. Applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate individual or group behavior through agents, enhancing our understanding of social dynamics.
2. Developing novel algorithms to support these simulations more comprehensively.
3. Improving AI alignment through a better understanding of human belief systems.


## Application Process 

If you're interested in our research directions, please send an email to soda.sci.lab@gmail_dot_com with the following:

- Your CV
- A brief introduction about yourself, including:
  - Your research interests
  - Your academic and career goals
  - Your relevant skillsets
- An explanation of which research direction interests you most and why
